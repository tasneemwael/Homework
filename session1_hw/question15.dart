/*What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used?

statically-typed means that the variables will be checked during the complie-time(while writing the code not after click on run),so if there is any error in the variable name or the variable declared after using it or wrong data type used for wrong value , all this errors discovered early.
